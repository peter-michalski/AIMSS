\frametitle{Ranking}

\begin{itemize}

\item Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making with multiple options
  and multiple criteria
\item Options = software products, Criteria = Qualities
\item Relative comparisons%, rather than requiring an unattainable unified scale
\item $n$ \textit{options} (software products) and $m$
\textit{criteria} (qualities)
\item For each quality a pairwise comps between each software
\item Forms an $n$x$n$ matrix $a$.  The value of $a_{jk}$ ranges from:
\bi
\item $1$, when options $j$ and $k$ are equally successful, to 
\item $9$, when option $j$ is extremely more successful than option $k$ 
\ei
\item Prioritize qualities to select the best software% for a given project
\item Previously calculated $a$ from a measure out of 10
\item Recommend - pairwise comparision with domain experts
